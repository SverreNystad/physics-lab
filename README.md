# Lab Report: Pure Rolling on a Curved Path - TFY4125 Physics Spring 2024
This lab report documents the findings of an experiment conducted by Eduard Prokhorikhin, Kristoffer Nohr Olaisen, Siv Alme and Sverre Nystad
focusing on the behavior of a rolling object on a curved path. It combines theoretical background with practical observations and numerical analysis to explore the dynamics of pure rolling motion.

# Experiment and Analysis
The report details the theoretical principles governing the motion of a rolling object, including energy conservation, forces involved, and the impact of the path's curvature and slope on the object's velocity and acceleration. Through a mix of markdown explanations and Python code, the report outlines the methodology for calculating these dynamics and visualizing the path characteristics and rolling motion.
